# Basic-Python

This repository includes basic level Python scripting. One will find examples of basic user input/outputs, loops, list creation, conditionals and low-level math. The intention of this repository is to display building blocks, which will later serve in more sophisticated analytic scripture.

Initially, I wrote this code in Visual Studio Code. I had intended on creating individual .py files for each category/basic skill I had wanted to display. However, I began to feel this was creating too many unnecessary files in the repository and I wasn't practicing the proper Github commit procedure as I worked through the code. I then moved on to creating a Jupyter Notebook. I feel working with Python in a Jupyter notebook is much easier to use than Visual Studio Code.
